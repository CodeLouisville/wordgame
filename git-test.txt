******How to add Git Comments to your Asana project tasks. *****

This service adds commit messages as comments to Asana tasks. Once enabled, commit messages
are checked for Asana task URLs (for example, https://app.asana.com/0/12345678/9012345) or task IDs
starting with # (for example, #9012345). Every task ID found will get the commit comment added to it.

A commit with the message:

Fixes layout rendering bug. Reported in https://app.asana.com/0/12345678/9012345

will show up as:
<commiter> pushed to branch <branch> of <user>/<repo> (http://github.com/<user>/<repo>/commit/<commit id>) -Fixes layout rendering bug. Reported in https://app.asana.com/0/12345678/9012345
Install Notes

    Auth Token - User API token. User must have access to task, all comments will be attributed to this user. See: http://developer.asana.com/documentation/#Authentication
    Restrict to Branch - Comma-separated list of branches which will be automatically inspected. Leave blank to include all branches.
    Restrict to Last Commit - Will only inspect the last commit of each push for task IDs.

We will run this service when an event is triggered.

Note:  Errins Notes....

In Asana create a tag with the task id # and then add it to your git commit, see example below.
In Git git commit -a -m "asana task_id = '#28416484662336' https://app.asana.com/0/24129616710901/28416484662336"
Push to my local repo on git-hub, not code louisville, to see commit comments show up on Asana, its in your personal
clone repo or orignal that i set up the Git and Asana link.  This is where im at so far, the only issue it post 3 times.
but it post.. will work on this. Share if you know of a better way, but this works ok.
