# WordGame
HTML5 and JavaScript game.  User has to guess the correct word!  Yay!


02/05/2015 - Rob Richardson Notes

RULES -- You must only use technologies that we have learned in class.  So as of 02/05/2015 this will be
   - HTML5
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
In the coming weeks, we can throw in some jquery, ajax calls, use some sass.  

Some features that need to be added 

  * Keep track of user guess attempts
     1. Limit user to only x guess attempts.. Such as 5.  After 5 is hit print that they lost the game.
  
  * Associate hints with each word... So maybe we use a random function to pick a word, then the user will
    be displayed a hint associated with that word.  T/hen the user has 5 attempts to guess the meaning of
    the word.  
    

If you can think of anymore cool features, just add it to this list.
